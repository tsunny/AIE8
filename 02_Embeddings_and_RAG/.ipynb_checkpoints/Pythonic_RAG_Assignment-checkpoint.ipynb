    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",

    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a common issue where a CEO or startup founder who used to be deeply involved in a particular function (e.g., product management, sales, or marketing) hires a weak executive to run that function after they have moved on. This often happens because the CEO has a hard time letting go of the function that brought them to the company and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. The problem is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who was a brilliant TV network executive. When he acquired ABC at Disney, ABC fell to fourth place. Eisner's response was that if he had an extra two days a week, he could turn ABC around himself. However, he did not have that extra time, illustrating the challenge and folly of hiring weak executives in your former specialty and trying to do it all yourself (Source 1).\n",

Here's what we accomplished:\n\n1. **PDF Document Loading**: Created a `PDFLoader` class that can extract text from PDF files\n2. **Document Chunking**: Used the existing `CharacterTextSplitter` to break PDF content into manageable chunks\n3. **Vector Database**: Converted PDF chunks into embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model and stored them in a `VectorDatabase`\n4. **RAG Pipeline**: Created a complete RAG pipeline that can answer questions based on PDF content\n\n**Key Features Added:**\n- Support for PDF file format alongside text files\n- Page-by-page processing option for maintaining document structure\n- Semantic search capabilities on PDF content\n- Integration with the existing RAG pipeline architecture\n\n**Next Steps:**\nYou can further enhance this by:\n- Adding support for other document formats (DOCX, HTML, etc.)\n- Implementing better text preprocessing for PDFs\n- Adding metadata support (page numbers, sections, etc.)\n- Using different embedding models or chunking strategies\n- Adding document source tracking in responses",
