    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",

    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to the tendency of CEOs (or startup founders) to hire weak executives to run the function or specialty that originally brought them to their leadership position. This happens because the CEO has a hard time letting go of that particular function and wants to remain in control or be \"the man\" in that area. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who was a brilliant TV network executive but, after buying ABC, saw it fall to fourth place. He responded by saying that if he had an extra two days a week, he could turn ABC around himself, but he did not have that time. Essentially, instead of hiring strong executives for their former specialty, some CEOs deliberately hire weak ones, which can result in poor performance in that function. This is highlighted in Source 1, which states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This sounds silly, but you wouldn’t believe how often it happens. The CEO who used to be a product manager who has a weak product management executive. The CEO who used to be in sales who has a weak sales executive. The CEO who used to be in marketing who has a weak marketing executive. I call this the “Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem” — after the CEO of Disney who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive. When he bought ABC at Disney, it promptly fell to fourth place. His response? 'If I had an extra two days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.' Well, guess what, he didn’t have an extra two days a week. A CEO — or a startup founder — often has a hard time letting go of the function that brought him to the party. The result: you hire someone weak into the executive role for that function so that you can continue to be 'the man'...\"\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is DynamoDB?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, Dynamo (the basis for DynamoDB) is a highly available data storage technology designed to meet the needs of applications that require an “always writable” data store where no updates are rejected due to failures or concurrent writes. It has a simple key/value interface, is highly available with a clearly defined consistency window, and is efficient in resource usage with a simple scale-out scheme to handle growth in data size and request rates [Source 2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Dynamo differs from traditional decentralized storage systems in that it targets applications requiring continuous writability without write rejections, operates within a single trusted administrative domain, and does not support hierarchical namespaces or complex relational schemas typical of traditional databases [Source 3]. It is built for latency-sensitive applications that demand at least 99.9% of read and write operations to complete within a few hundred milliseconds, emphasizing minimal routing through multiple nodes to meet these latency requirements [Source 3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Dynamo provides tunable parameters (N,R,W) to adjust the consistency and availability characteristics according to the application's needs. Unlike many commercial data stores, Dynamo exposes consistency and reconciliation logic to developers, allowing for flexible but potentially more complex application logic. Historically, many Amazon applications were already designed to handle different failure modes and inconsistencies, making integration with Dynamo relatively straightforward [Source 1].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, DynamoDB is an evolution or implementation based on the Dynamo design principles: a highly available, scalable, key/value storage system optimized for applications requiring high availability, low latency, and tunable consistency, primarily used within trusted domains and for applications without complex relational querying needs.\n",
      "Sources used: 3\n",
      "Similarity scores: ['Source 1: 0.648', 'Source 2: 0.647', 'Source 3: 0.645']\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the core principles that DynamoDB is designed on?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided context, the core principles that Dynamo (and by extension DynamoDB, as Dynamo is the foundational system) is designed on include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Simple Query Model**: Dynamo targets applications that need simple read and write operations to data items uniquely identified by keys. The state is stored as binary objects (blobs) identified by unique keys, with no operations spanning multiple data items and no need for relational schema. This is because many Amazon services can operate with this simple model and usually work with objects smaller than 1 MB. (Source 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Availability and Writeability**: Dynamo is targeted mainly at applications that need an \"always writeable\" data store where no updates are rejected due to failures or concurrent writes. This is crucial for Amazon’s applications requiring high availability. (Source 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incremental Scalability**: Dynamo should be able to scale out one storage host (node) at a time, with minimal impact on both the system and its operators. This enables smooth and continuous growth. (Source 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Symmetry**: Every node in Dynamo has the same set of responsibilities, with no distinguished node taking special roles or extra responsibilities. This symmetry simplifies system provisioning and maintenance. (Source 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Decentralization**: While only partly visible in the context, decentralization is implied as a principle that complements symmetry, implying no single point of failure or bottleneck. (Source 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Latency Sensitivity**: Dynamo is built for latency-sensitive applications that require at least 99.9% of read and write operations to be performed within a few hundred milliseconds. To meet this latency, it's imperative to avoid routing requests through multiple nodes. (Source 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Targeted Environment**: Dynamo is built for an infrastructure within a single administrative domain where all nodes are assumed to be trusted. (Source 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Dynamo allows flexibility in conflict resolution—for example, applications can merge conflicting versions or use simple policies like \"last write wins\"—but it does not enforce strong transactional guarantees like ACID properties since its use cases do not require them. (Sources 1 and 2)\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Answer: Failure detection in DynamoDB (Dynamo) is primarily managed without maintaining a global, consistent view of failure state. Initially, Dynamo used a decentralized failure detector based on a simple gossip-style protocol, which enabled nodes to learn about the arrival or departure of other nodes. However, the design evolved away from this approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, failure detection now relies on a combination of explicit node join and leave methods and the observation of communication failures during request forwarding. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nodes are notified of permanent node additions and removals via explicit join and leave operations.\n",
      "- Temporary failures of nodes are detected locally by individual nodes when they attempt to communicate with other nodes and fail to do so (e.g., during request forwarding).\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach removes the need for a globally consistent failure state.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Source 3: \"Early designs of Dynamo used a decentralized failure detector... Later it was determined that the explicit node join and leave methods obviates the need for a global view of failure state... temporary node failures are detected by the individual nodes when they fail to communicate with others (while forwarding requests).\")\n",
